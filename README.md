# Nextcloud for Franz

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)

This is an unofficial [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) recipe for version 5+ of the [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/) chat client.

For installation instructions, see the [Franz Plugins documentation](https://github.com/meetfranz/plugins/blob/master/docs/integration.md#installation). The directory name needs to be "nextcloud".

## Why not use just a custom website

The custom website recipe in Franz is does not accept my login site.
This module does not verify urls.
